# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-04-04

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey with you all, as I build up my new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a newe Astro project and then I set up my online accounts for the project.
2. **Making Pages**: Then I learned how to make pages by creating a few new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: I have also learned to make a blog post, this is my first blog post! I now have both Astro pages and Markdown posts! Awesome.....

## What's next?

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this site for more to come...
